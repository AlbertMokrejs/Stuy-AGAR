Class Game{
  -initializes game world, arraylist of orbs and a player orb.
  -Has a Turn() method which runs turns per each orbs: processing prints at this time.
  -Checks if player is alive: ends game if dead.
  -Displays score.
  }
  
Class Orb{
  -is an orb: keeps track of its Size, xCord, yCord.
  -if its too close to another orb (which is bigger) it'll delete itself and increase the other orbs size.
  -otherwise it would use vector addition and mildRNG to determine an optimal direction to travel.
      -Travel speed is inversely proportional to size.
  -can have its size increased by other orbs as they die.
  }
  
Class PlayerOrb extends Orb{
  -is an orb, keeps track of its Size, xCord, yCord.
  -takes player inputs to move in real time.
      -Speed based on inverse of size.
  -if it gets too close to another orb it dies. Death ends the game, as monitored by Game.
  -can have its size increased by other orbs as they die.
  }
